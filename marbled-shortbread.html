                    These cookies are kind of a visual show stopper. I made them for my cookie boxes this year because I’m a sucker for a pretty cookie. They don’t pack too much of a punch in the flavor department. Don’t get me wrong, I love a buttery shortbread, which they no doubt are, but they truly cary their weight in the looks department. My one tip when making these cookies is to chill your dough if you feel like it’s getting too soft to handle and to not be intimidated if the outside starts to look muddled. The inside will look beautiful, I promise. Have faith and make these beautiful cookies!

                <h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
                <p>
                    In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine butter, confectioners sugar, and salt. Mix on medium speed until well combined but not aerated. Add water and extracts and mix on medium speed until thoroughly combined, ~3-4 minutes. Add the flour and mix on low until just combined.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lay a 13-by-18 inch piece of parchment paper on the counter with the long side facing you. Remove 300 grams of dough and place it on the left side of the parchment paper. Fold the paper in half and roll the dough into a rectangle measuring 13-by-9 inches. Set this dough aside. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Divide the remaining dough into 4 portions (about 110 grams each). Color these doughs, I prefer using gel food coloring for the most look, and form into logs measuring 9-inches across. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Peel the parchment paper off the top of the uncolored dough sheet but leave the dough on the bottom parchment. Place the first colored log on the bottom edge of the plain dough sheet. Lift the bottom edge of the dough sheet and roll until the colored log is just barely encased. Cut the remaining dough so you are left with a completely encased colored log. Repeat with two of the remaining colored dough logs (you will have one left over uncovered). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stack the dough logs on top of one another so you have a 2-by-2 formation. Squeeze the dough together and roll the log until it measures approximately 14 inches. Cut the dough in half and stack the two halves on top of one another. Squeeze these together and repeat the rolling and cutting process 2-3 more times depending on how large you would like your splotches of dough to be. Roll the final log to 14 inches, wrap in parchment paper, and chill for at least 4 but up to 24 hours. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Preheat the oven to 350°F and position the racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven. Remove the chilled dough from the refrigerator. Place the sprinkles in a gimme baking sheet. Brush the exterior of the log with water and roll the dough in the sprinkles so they adhere to the outside of the log. Cut the log into 1/4 inch thick slices and transfer to a parchment lined baking sheet.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bake the cookies until the tops are matte and pale but not yet brown, rotating halfway through, approximately 15 minutes. Cool and enjoy!
