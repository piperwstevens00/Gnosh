                    These cookies are it. I don’t want to overhype how absolutely, decadently delicious these cookies are, but they simply exist on another level. The cookies have browned butter, peanut brittle chunks, and chocolate chips. What makes them the creme de la creme? I think the interplay of peanuty, caramely saltiness of the brittle with the deep browned butter flavor and the dark and milk chocolate just works. In case you missed it, there are both milk and dark chocolate chips in this cookie (this was a matter of personal preference). I got the bulk chocolate bars from Trader Joe’s and chopped the chocolate into irregularly shaped chips. I also added more chocolate to the tops of each cookie before placing them in the oven to achieve the ‘pooled’ chocolate look. This step is optional, of course, but if you’re gonna go for it, why not go all in? These cookies are definitely more time and labor intensive than your average chocolate chip cookie, but if you have a few extra hours on the weekend, MAKE THESE COOKIES.

                <h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
                <h3>peanut brittle</h3>
                <p>
                    If you are using raw (non-roasted) peanuts, toast the peanuts in a 350°F oven for ~10 minutes until they are fragrant. Combine granulated sugar, butter, and 1 tbsp of water in a medium saucepan. Before you start making the toffee, measure the salt and baking soda into a small dish and place it beside your stove top. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Heat the saucepan on medium heat, stirring until the mixture reaches a boil. Once the sugar mixture starts to boil, switch to swirling your pan, this encourages even heat distribution without causing crystallization. Go low and slow on this step, it’ll take about 10 minutes for the sugar to cook fully. Once the mixture turns a deep amber color, turn off the heat and add the toasted peanuts and stir to coat. Working quickly, stir in the baking soda and salt, then spread it into a thin layer on your parchment lined baking sheet. Allow the brittle to cool at room temperature while you make the cookie dough. Once it is fully cooled, chop it into chocolate chip sized pieces to be incorporated into your cookie dough.
                </p>
                <h3>cookies</h3>
                <p>
                    Brown the butter in a saucepan. Melt, stirring occasionally, over medium heat until the butter foams and milk solids have separated from the butter and have turned a toasted amber color. The butter will smell nutty when it’s done. Remove from heat and allow to cool for 10 minutes. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Add the sugars to the browned butter and beat using an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment until fully combined. Add eggs, yolks, and vanilla, then mix on medium speed until fully combined and mixture is pale (~3-4 minutes). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add the dry ingredients to the wet and mix until just combined. Add the chocolate chips and chopped brittle to the batter and mix by hand until evenly distributed. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Portion batter into 40 g balls (you can also use a medium 1¾-inch (#40) cookie scoop or 2 tablespoons) and place them close together on a baking sheet. Add extra chocolate to the tops of the dough balls if you want pooled chocolate on the tops of your cookies. Cover with plastic wrap and allow the dough to cool for at least 4 hours and up to 12 hours. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you’re ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350°F. Transfer the cookies to parchment lined baking sheets (you can fit 8 cookies per tray). Sprinkle the tops with sea salt before transferring the baking sheets to the oven. Bake 14-16 minutes until golden brown around the edges and paler in the middle, rotating baking sheets halfway through. Allow the cookies to cool slightly (or don’t haha) and enjoy!
