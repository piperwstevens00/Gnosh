                    Let’s talk about brownies. It’s 2021, we’ve all had a long year, I think can all cut the fluff and admit to ourselves and the world that no one actually likes cakey brownies. Fudgy is king, the darker the better (in my opinion). There are a few ways to make brownies fudgy. The most important is to limit the amount of flour, because flower causes lift. Next, bake the brownies for less time than a traditional boxed brownie recipe. These brownies bake for 20-25 minutes instead of the typical 40. Don’t worry, they’re not underbaked, the shorter baking time just gives rise to maximum fudge. Finally, and this is very important, chill the brownies before and after baking. Chilling before allows for the brown sugar to crystalize which leads to delicious caramelization in the oven. Chilling after allows the brownies to set into this decadent, dense, fudge-like brownie. Have I said fudge enough times in this blurb?

                    Three final notes before you go. First, this is pretty much just a very fancy chocolate bar, so high-quality chocolate makes a difference. Second, brown butter is incredible, whatever you do don’t skip browning your butter. And finally, eat these with ice cream, you won’t be sorry.

                    <li> 3/4 cup (92g) whole wheat flour</li>
                    <li>1/3 cup (25g) dutch-process cocoa powder</li>
                    <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
                    <li>4–5 oz 90% dark chocolate, chopped</li>
                    <li>Flaky sea salt, for sprinkling </li>

                <h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
                <p>
                    Preheat oven to 350ºF and line an 8x8 in. baking sheet with parchment paper.           
                <p>
                    Add the chopped 60% dark chocolate to a mixing bowl. Brown the butter by heating it over medium heat until it starts to simmer. Continue stirring until foam forms on the top of the butter (5-8 minutes). Heat until the butter turns a deep amber color, gives off a nutty odor, and contains solid brown flecks. Add the browned butter to the chocolate and stir until melted and combined. Whisk in the espresso powder.                </p>
                <p>
                    Give the butter/chocolate mixture a few minutes to cool, then add both sugars and mix. Add the eggs and vanilla. Whisk until the batter thickens and is fully combined.                 </p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, and salt in a separate bowl. Sift the dry ingredients into the wet and fold with a rubber spatula until just combined. Add about ¾ of the chopped 90% dark chocolate and fold until evenly distributed. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pour batter into the baking sheet, spread evenly, then top with remaining chocolate chunks. Cool the brownies overnight (or as long as you can stand not eating them). Bake for 20-25 minutes, until chocolate is melted and the surface is crackled and glossy. Sprinkle with flakey sea salt. Cool the brownies on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then transfer to the fridge for at least one hour (or as long as you want). Slice and enjoy with ice cream :)
