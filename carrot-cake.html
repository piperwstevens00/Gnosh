                    This chocolate carrot cake is vegan. Don’t freak out, the absence of dairy and eggs causes this cake to be dense and extremely moist. I was skeptical at first, what’s the point of baking without butter and eggs? I promise, though, this cake is incredible. Adding chocolate to the cake takes a classic carrot cake to the next level. Throw on some carrot decoration and a few frosting swirls on top for a super cute, delicious cake for the cake lover.

                <h3>chocolate carrot cake</h3>
                <p>
                    Preheat the oven to 350°F and line two 10” cake pans with parchment paper. In a stand mixer, beat the eggs and sugars on high speed for 2 minutes until light and fluffy. Reduce the speed to medium and add the oil. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Turn the mixer off and add the flour, baking soda, melted chocolate, and cocoa. Mix until incorporated. Fold in the shredded carrots. Divide the batter evenly between two pans and bake for 1 hour and 30 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.
                </p>
                <h3>cream cheese frosting</h3>
                <p>
                    Mix the cream cheese in a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on medium speed for a few minutes until light and airy. Add the butter and mix until incorporated. Add the vanilla and sugar and mix on low until smooth. Switch to a whist attachment and whip on high until light an fluffy. Reserve about 1/3 cup of frosting and color it orange and green. Frost the cake, then pipe lines of orange frosting to represent carrots. Top each carrot with two green leaves.
