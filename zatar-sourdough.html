                    Sourdough is one of the great rabbit holes that most bakers are bound to go down. Whether it’s a quarantine obsession or something that becomes part of a weekly practice, there is something about creating bread from three simple ingredients, flour, water, and salt, that is tantalizing. I will be there first to admit that I 
                    am likely years and thousands of trials away from perfecting my sourdough loaf. However, If you are looking for a guide on how to make sourdough, I recommend this recipe from the renowned bakery <a class="paragraph-link" href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016277-tartines-country-bread">Tartine</a>, or 
                    Claire Saffitz’s wonderful <a class="paragraph-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JRSF-zDgvk">video</a>. This post is simply my ratios and technique for making my most recent exploration into the world of flavored sourdoughs. This loaf is made unique by the incorperation of a mixture of za’atar (a deliciousssss mediteranian spice blend) and oil into the bread. To incorporate za’atar into the loaf, I used a lamination technique. After adding the starter and salt to the dough, I let it sit for 30 minutes, then 
                    flatten it in a thin layer on the counter. I spread the oil over that layer, then fold the dough onto itself to incorporate the oil. From there, I continue on to the bulk fermentation phase. <a class="paragraph-link" href="https://www.pantrymama.com/how-to-laminate-sourdough/">Here</a> is a great guide for laminating sourdough.

                <h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        7:30 AM - feed sourdough starter
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        11:30 AM - mix flours and 770 g water, cover to autolyse
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        12:30 PM - pinch in sourdough starter then add salt and water. Mix vigorously to fully combine. Slap and fold until bread is smooth (ish) and there is noticeable gluten development
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        1:15 PM - combine za’atar and oil to create a spreadable paste. Divide dough in half and laminate each with 1/2 of the za’atar mixture
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        1:15 - 6:00 PM - bulk ferment. Perform 3 coil folds spaced 30 minutes apart within the first three hours of bulk fermentation
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        6:00 PM - shape loaves and transfer to bowls with flour dusted tea towels. Place in refrigerator to proof overnight.
                        <ul><li>Loaves shaped using the thirds method. Spread dough into a rectangle, fold the dough over itself in thirds, then roll from the far end of the dough to create a tight loaf. Let sit for a few minutes on the seam, then transfer seam side up into the prepared shaping bowl. </li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Next Morning- bake at 500°F in a covered dutch oven for 25 minutes with ~2 ice cubes, then uncovered at 475°F for 25 minutes until deep brown. Cool completely before slicing.
