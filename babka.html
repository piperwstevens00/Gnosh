                    Babka, a wonderful fusion of chocolate and bread: It’s an on-the-go cinnamon roll. It’s the chocolate lover’s toast option. It’s everything you could want in a breakfast loaf. To make babka, a typical sweet yeast dough is rolled out and filled with a chocolate filling. There is definitely freedom to experiment with the filling flavors (cinnamon, Biscoff, matcha, etc.). Personally, I’m a traditionalist and prefer the chocolate.

                    The crux of this recipe is shaping the loaf. I suggest searching YouTube videos before diving in. I was a little disappointed with the thickness of my layers. When I make this loaf again, I am planning on rolling the dough out thinner to get more layers and give the loaf a classic Babka look. The last thing to note is the streusel topping. This is optional but HIGHLY recommended. Much like sprinkles, I have never regreted topping anything with streusel.

                <h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
                <h3>sweet yeast dough</h3>
                <p>
                    Warm the milk in a saucepan until warm but not hot (105°F). Pour ~  ¼ cup of milk in a separate bowl, stir in yeast to dissolve, and let sit for 5 minutes. The mixture should bubble and foam, indicating that the yeast is alive. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the flour, sugar, salt, and butter. Make a well in the center and pour in the eggs, yeast mixture, and remaining butter. Attach a dough hook and mix on low until the flour has been wetted. Continue mixing on medium speed until the butter is incorporated and the dough is soft and sticky (~5 minutes). Stop and scrape the mixer, then continue mixing until the dough pulls away from the bowl and is smooth and supple (another 5 minutes). The dough will be soft, but if it sticks to the bowl at medium high speed, add flour one tablespoon at a time until it no longer sticks. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Place the dough in a medium sized bowl and let sit until it’s 50 percent expanded in size, 1-1 1/2 hours. Transfer the bowl to the refrigerator and let rise overnight (or at least 4 hours).                 
                </p>
                <h3>babka</h3>
                <p>
                    Brush the bottom and sides of two loaf pans with melted butter and line the long sides with parchment paper. Preheat the oven too 350°F
                </p>
                <p>
                    To make the filling: in a saucepan over medium heat, combine sugar, cream, and salt. Simmer, stirring periodically, until the sugar has completely dissolved. Transfer to a bowl and add the chocolate, butter, and vanilla. Stir until smooth. Let cool at room temperature or in a refrigerator until it is a spreadable consistency. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    To make the streusel: in a bowl, stir together flour, sugar, cocoa powder, and salt. Stir in melted butter until the mixture forms large, moist crumbs. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    To shape: remove the dough from the refrigerator and divide in half. Working one at a time, roll each piece into a 9-by-17-inch rectangle (this is a minimum, you can roll it larger if you want more layers). Spread half the filling over the dough then roll into a tight coil from the long side. Transfer to the freezer for 10 minutes and repeat with the other piece of dough. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Slice the coils in half lengthwise then layer one half on top of the other. Twist the two coils over a few more times to make a twisted shape then transfer to the loaf pan. Cover the pans with a kitchen towel and let rise until puffy, 1-1 ½ hours. Once risen, top with the streusel and bake for 50-50 min. The loaves will sound hollow and a thermometer will read between 185-210 degrees when inserted. Cool completely before slicing.
