                I bought my boyfriend fancy sprinkles two weeks before he asked me out. He claims it has nothing to do with our current relationship status.
                The way I see it, I gave him fancy sprinkles, now he’s in love with me. 
                I’m not one to infer causation, but I’d say I have some pretty strong evidence that sprinkles are the foundation of our relationship. Regardless, sprinkles are 
                the best. They make everything brighter and more whimsical. I literally cannot count the times that I have frosted a cake or cupcakes, 
                been disappointed with the result, then added sprinkles and called it a day. They are the baker’s equivalent of white out.

                <p>
                The addition of sprinkles in this recipe, however, is very intentional. The recipe is a classic funfetti cake with cream cheese frosting. 
                There are so many funfetti cake recipes out there. I have tried quite a few including the ever trendy Momofoku milk bar funfetti cake (Christina Tosi is a goddess), but it wasn’t quite as moist as this one.
                 If you are one of those people who thinks funfetti cake is too sugary or too childish or too basic, I’ll tell you this:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The cream cheese cuts through the sugar. Seriously, cream cheese frosting has yet to fail me.</li>
                    <li>Nostalgia never hurt anyone. Please, please please, drive to you local grocery store, pick up some low quality rainbow sprinkles, and taste the rainbow. </li>
